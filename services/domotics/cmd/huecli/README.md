# huecli

This is a small command line tool to allow you to pair the deviced Hue bridge implementation with a physical Hue bridge. This persists the bridge ID and key to the database at the specified path; supply this path to the config yaml in deviced for it to take effect.

You can use your existing network information to supply the IP address, or access https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp as a shortcut.
